            <br><br>&nbsp;This project falls under the collaboration between <a href="https://imdl.naist.jp/" target="_blank">IMD lab</a> and <a href="http://icb-lab.naist.jp/index.html" target="_blank">ICB lab</a> of <a href="https://www.naist.jp/" target="_blank">NAIST</a> and surgeons from <a href="https://www.ome.med.osaka-u.ac.jp/" target="_blank">Osaka</a> and <a href="https://www.m.ehime-u.ac.jp/school/orthopedic/" target="_blank">Ehime</a> University.
            <br><br>&nbsp;The purpose of this demo was to show the surgeons the potential of AR in surgical training. We hypothesize that by observing different perspectives of a higher-skilled performance, it can facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge and skill to the learner. To test this, we illustrate with the piano-playing scenario (because there are many common points with the general surgical operation).
            <br><br>&nbsp;Shared gaze visualization encourages mutual gaze awareness with a relatively low mental effort. By observing the gaze visualization of an expert, we hope that it will provide the novice with opportunities for insights and realizations. That is why, in this system, we provide them with gaze information in real-time, in playback, and in heat map visualization.

            &nbsp;This work is one of the projects that fall under <a href="http://ausilia.tn.it/" target="_blank">AUSILIA</a>, which is a collaboration between researchers from <a href="https://www.miro.ing.unitn.it/" target="_blank">MiRo lab</a> and therapists from <a href="http://ausilia.tn.it/index.php/abilita/" target="_blank">Villa Rosa Rehabilitation Hospital</a>. I developed this AR system during my internship at <a href="https://www.unitn.it/en" target="_blank">UniTrento</a>, Italy.
            <!-- <br><br>&nbsp;Activities of Daily Living (ADL) are the fundamental skills that allow a person to care for themselves independently. For our test case, we focus on the ADL of setting the kitchen table. -->
            <br><br>&nbsp;We made a shared AR system that is inserted into the usual rehabilitation workflow during the therapist-patient interaction. The therapist places virtual kitchen utensils, and the patient is tasked with matching the placement of the real utensils to the virtual to achieve the goal of setting up the table ADL task. We also provide a scoring system for the therapist to judge the performance of the patient, showing how much each of the real utensils is off from its virtual counterpart in terms of distance and angle, and how long they took to complete the task.
            <br><br>&nbsp;We conducted a pilot study with 1 healthy person as a baseline and 3 real patients. Although we do not have long-term results, initial patient feedback indicated that the therapist's required ADL tasks were easier to understand. The therapist also liked the scoring system as a guide for diagnosis and said that adding this AR system to the usual rehabilitation workflow will be very useful.

            <br><br>&nbsp;The concept of this project is to train the "clinical eye" of the therapist. The clinical eye refers to the observational skills and competence of the therapist in formulating a diagnostic hypothesis about the patient. We propose that by presenting real-time visualizations of the invisible current conditions of the patient in AR, it will help the therapist train their clinical eye.
            <br><br>&nbsp;We have collaborated with local occupational therapists in Japan and developed prototypes that they will use in their evaluation workflow.

            <br><br>&nbsp;The concept of this project is to create AR training systems that use the patient's real computed tomography (CT) scan data to trigger perceptions of deep immersion with the goal of improving the learning, knowledge, skill, and performance of surgeons. We use "image training" theory to create simulators that provide surgeons with a multisensory experience of the imitated operating room conditions. Bone fracture exploration and muscle study are two examples, as seen in the left and right images respectively.

            &nbsp;The <a href="https://imdl.naist.jp/ja/tsundereproject/" target="_blank">Tsundere Project</a> is a side research project started by members of the IMD lab, with Keishi Tainaka as our leader. This began with us playing with robotic arms synchronized with AR visualizations, as seen in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/gd33x51crfq4yqh/CICP_Kaguya.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank">this video</a>. We then took this idea and applied for the Creative and International Competitiveness Project (CICP), got a research budget, and won the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/cicp2020-final-presentation" target="_blank">best research project award for CICP 2020.</a>
            <br><br>&nbsp;Activities for this side project have continued since then, including publishing a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3434074.3447149" target="_blank">short paper at HRI 2021</a>. We also successfully established a collaboration with a maid cafe in Osaka called <a href="https://ccocha.com/" target="_blank">CCOちゃ</a> and worked with them, for example, on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/k4npttc6vc7yxlm/%E3%83%8A%E3%83%8B%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AC%E7%8F%8D%E7%99%BE%E6%99%AF220710_%E3%83%84%E3%83%B3%E3%83%87%E3%83%AC%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E7%B7%A8_%E3%82%BB%E3%83%84%E3%83%8A.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank">motion and voice data collection for tsundere</a>.

            <br><br>&nbsp;The Virtual Cheki (Instax) is one of the works under the <a href="https://imdl.naist.jp/ja/tsundereproject/" target="_blank">Tsundere Project</a>, which I am in charge of. 
            <br><br>&nbsp;The purpose of this application is to be able to take a photo with a virtual maid in 3D. How this works is that we use a depth camera (Intel RealSense D415) to generate a point cloud of a person in real-time. This point cloud is then used as a tool to make it feel like being immersed inside a 3D virtual maid cafe. Inside this 3D space, the guest can do a cat pose, a heart pose, or even hug the virtual maid (all accounting for proper occlusions), bringing with them a memorable photo at the end.
            <br><br>&nbsp;This work was demonstrated at <a href="https://twitter.com/project_okawaii/status/1607648249825091585?s=20&t=rQCf900nmUgf6KWLQ34R-A" target="_blank">Comic Market 101</a> on the first day, Friday, December 30, 2022, and will be shown at an event in <a href="https://ccocha.com/" target="_blank">maid cafe CCOちゃ</a> at some point in the future. As this is still an ongoing project, please wait for more future updates.

            &nbsp;Virtual Castell, or バーチャル人間の塔祭り, is the very first game I developed, back when I was still a master's student. This game was based on Animal Tower Battle (どうぶつタワーバトル), a popular mobile game in Japan at the time. The concept was to stack the animals as high as you could. The difference in my game is that you control the position and pose of the animal with your body, using the Kinect camera.
            <br><br>&nbsp;This game was featured during one of the open campus at NAIST to represent IMD Lab. Open campus is a time when families visit our school to learn about and experience the research projects done by the students. For me, it was truly a heartwarming experience to see the children enjoy the game that I had made. This event can be considered one of the many reasons why I decided to pursue my doctoral degree and strive to become a developer.

The AUSILIA system is an apartment-wide project fitted with a technical infrastructure that allows the individual to be tracked and supported at the premise during his stay. It is an atmosphere in which the individual stays for a certain period of time, and his daily operations are controlled by an integrated system in the room full of sensors. In this way, the doctor will be able to monitor and evaluate the patient remotely, as seen in the left image.

          <div class="highlight-info">
            &nbsp;Augmented Reality for Entertainment workshop was organized by Dr. Christian Sandor to train the skills of Information Science students from <a href="https://www.naist.jp/" target="_blank">NAIST</a> and Arts major students from <a href="https://www.chula.ac.th/en/" target="_blank">Chula</a> with the goal of creating a Movie of AR experience. Professors from University of Iowa, KAIST, and KARTS were also invited as guest speakers for this workshop.
            <br><br>&nbsp;I was still a master's student during this time and have just started learning the basics of AR development. For this workshop, I was tasked with doing the documentation of the whole event. The workshop video above is my first experience with camera operation and video editing, and personally, I'm proud of the result.

            &nbsp;The conferences that had the most impact on me were ISMAR 2020 and 2022 (left and right images, respectively). ISMAR 2020 was memorable because this conference was held entirely in virtual reality using <a href="https://www.virbela.com/" target="_blank">VirBELA</a>. Despite the ongoing pandemic at that time, the AR/VR academic community was still able to share their research and advancements at this conference. It was truly a fun experience interacting with other researchers like me in virtual reality.
            <br><br>&nbsp;Another memorable conference is ISMAR 2022, which was held in Singapore. Finally, the pandemic had already settled down, and people were once again allowed to hold large gatherings. This was memorable for me because I presented my research as a workshop paper in <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ismar-2022/home" target="_blank">Design and User Research in AR/VR/MR</a>. The event also sponsored side tours such as the Night Safari. You can read more about this in my <a href="https://imdl.naist.jp/blog_e/?p=2146" target="_blank">blog post here</a>.

            &nbsp;As seen in the left image, my doctoral research is about understanding the effectiveness of AR for training individuals. Most of my publications above are related to this topic. My interests include AR/VR development, either for research or for entertainment.

            &nbsp;I have a lot of hobbies and love trying new things, but the main ones that I have stuck to for years are basketball, guitar, and anime.
            <br><br>&nbsp;During my time at <a href="https://www.ateneo.edu/" target="_blank">ADMU</a>, I was part of an amateur team competing in intra-school tournaments; and at <a href="https://www.naist.jp/" target="_blank">NAIST</a>, I took on the role of leading the school basketball circle, with some of the members seen <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CjZlj5ZvIIG/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY=" target="_blank">here.</a>
            <br><br>&nbsp;I also enjoy playing the guitar and listening to music. Lately, most of the music I listen to are by mainstream Japanese artists, and currently my favorite is Tani Yuuki.
            <br><br>&nbsp;Watching anime has also become a big part of my life. In times when I feel down and lose motivation, I usually rewatch this <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxaCHVrnyqCOLaw6MyH9vgWqnyI8DxVLeG" target="_blank">scene</a> from "Uchuu Kyoudai" on not giving up on your dream.
            <br><br>&nbsp;In my free time, I also like to learn the Japanese language. I have already passed the JLPT N3 exam and finished all the courses at my school, so I am trying out other methods at the moment. This includes speaking to my friends, listening to Youtube streams, and reading manga, all in Japanese.
